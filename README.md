## Solar panels

Project created to predict daily power production of solar panels.
For this task I used dataset from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fvcoppen/solarpanelspower?select=PV_Elec_Gas3.csv).
On top of that I fetched weather data from [API](https://open-meteo.com/) and created an ensemble regression model for regression approach and VAR model for time series approach.
